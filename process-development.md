# Process Development Guide

## Purpose
This document outlines the process for developing and implementing features, solving problems, or managing initiatives. It serves as a framework to ensure consistency, efficiency, and alignment with project objectives.

---

## 1. Define the Objective
- Clearly state the purpose of the process or feature.
- Break it into smaller, actionable steps if necessary.
- Example: "Develop a feature that allows users to [specific action] to achieve [specific benefit]."

---

## 2. Gather Requirements
- Identify all functional and non-functional requirements.
- Example:
  - Functional: The system must allow users to upload files up to 10MB.
  - Non-functional: The system must process uploads within 2 seconds.

---

## 3. Design the Solution
- Outline the architecture, workflows, or design patterns to be used.
- Example:
  - Use a microservices architecture for scalability.
  - Implement RESTful APIs for communication between services.

---

## 4. Develop the Solution
- Follow coding standards and best practices (e.g., PEP 8 for Python).
- Use modular, reusable, and well-documented code.
- Example:
  - Use Fluent UI for frontend components.
  - Use `pytest` for backend testing.

---

## 5. Test and Validate
- Perform unit, integration, and end-to-end testing.
- Example:
  - Write unit tests to achieve 95% code coverage.
  - Validate the solution against the defined requirements.

---

## 6. Deployment
- Prepare the solution for deployment.
- Example:
  - Use Azure DevOps pipelines for CI/CD.
  - Ensure all environment variables are securely stored.

---

## 7. Monitor and Optimize
- Track performance and user feedback post-deployment.
- Example:
  - Monitor KPIs such as response time and error rates.
  - Optimize the solution based on feedback and analytics.

---

## 8. Documentation and Handover
- Document the process, solution, and any relevant details.
- Example:
  - Update the project README with usage instructions.
  - Provide a handover session for the operations team.

---

## 9. Continuous Improvement
- Regularly review and refine the process.
- Example:
  - Conduct retrospectives to identify areas for improvement.
  - Update the process based on lessons learned.
