# Planning Document

## Purpose
This document outlines the planning process for developing features, solving problems, or implementing initiatives. It serves as a guide to ensure clarity, consistency, and alignment with project goals.

---

## 1. Define the Problem or Objective
- Clearly articulate the problem, feature, or objective to be addressed.
- Break it into smaller, manageable components if necessary.
- Example: "As a user, I want to [specific action] so that [specific benefit]."

---

## 2. Background and Context
- Provide context for why this problem, feature, or initiative is important.
- Include any relevant history, challenges, or goals.
- Example: "This initiative is critical for improving user engagement by simplifying the onboarding process."

---

## 3. Goals and Success Criteria
- Define what success looks like for this task or initiative.
- Example:
  - The solution should meet user needs and align with project timelines.
  - The feature should improve performance by 20% or reduce errors by 15%.

---

## 4. Requirements
- List all requirements for the task or solution.
- Example:
  - The system must support three user roles: Admin, Editor, and Viewer.
  - The feature must integrate with the existing API.

---

## 5. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
- Define measurable KPIs to track the success of the initiative.
- Example:
  - Increase user retention by 10% within three months.
  - Reduce page load time to under 2 seconds.
  - Achieve 95% test coverage for the new feature.

---

## 6. Tools and Resources
- List tools, libraries, or frameworks to be used.
- Example:
  - Use Fluent UI for frontend components.
  - Use Azure DevOps for CI/CD pipelines.
  - Use `pytest` for automated testing.

---

## 7. Timeline and Milestones
- Define milestones and deadlines for the task or initiative.
- Example:
  - Week 1: Define scope and gather requirements.
  - Week 2: Develop and test the feature.
  - Week 3: Review, deploy, and measure results.

---

## 8. Risks and Mitigation
- Identify potential risks and how to address them.
- Example:
  - Risk: Delayed API integration.
  - Mitigation: Use mock data for testing until the API is ready.

---

## 9. Review and Feedback
- Outline the process for reviewing and incorporating feedback.
- Example:
  - Submit a pull request for code review.
  - Address all comments before merging.

---

## 10. Measurement and Reporting
- Define how progress and success will be measured and reported.
- Example:
  - Weekly progress reports to stakeholders.
  - Monthly KPI reviews to assess performance.
  - Post-implementation analysis to evaluate success.

---

## 11. Documentation and Handover
- Ensure all changes are documented and handed over to relevant teams.
- Example:
  - Update the README with usage instructions for the new feature.
  - Provide a knowledge transfer session for the operations team.

This structure ensures that all aspects of planning are covered, from problem definition to implementation, measurement, and review.
