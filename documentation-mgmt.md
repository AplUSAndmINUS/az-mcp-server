# Documentation Creation Workflow

## 1. Define the Scope
- Identify the purpose of the documentation (e.g., user guide, API reference, troubleshooting guide).
- Determine the target audience and their level of expertise.

## 2. Plan the Structure
- Outline the main sections and subsections.
- Use a logical flow to guide the reader through the content.

## 3. Gather Information
- Collect all relevant details, including technical specifications, workflows, and examples.
- Reference existing documentation or code where applicable.

## 4. Write the Content
- Use clear, concise, and consistent language.
- Follow Markdown formatting for headings, lists, and code blocks.
- Include examples, diagrams, or screenshots where helpful.
- Use Confluence for collaborative documentation efforts when needed.

## 5. Ensure Accessibility
- Use proper heading hierarchy for screen readers.
- Add alt text for all images and diagrams.
- Ensure sufficient color contrast for readability.
- Use plain language to make content easier to understand.

## 6. Review and Edit
- Proofread for grammar, spelling, and clarity.
- Ensure technical accuracy by consulting developers or subject matter experts.
- Verify that the content adheres to PEP 8 and project-specific guidelines.

## 7. Test the Documentation
- Follow the steps or instructions in the documentation to ensure accuracy.
- Confirm that all links, references, and examples work as intended.

## 8. Version Control
- Save the documentation in the appropriate project folder.
- Commit changes to a feature branch with a descriptive commit message:
  ```
  [JIRA-123] Add initial draft of documentation for [feature/module]
  ```
- Push the branch and create a pull request for review.

## 9. Address Feedback
- Incorporate feedback from reviewers promptly.
- Ensure all comments are resolved before merging.

## 10. Localization
- Prepare documentation for translation if needed.
- Use tools like `gettext` or `Crowdin` to manage localization.
- Ensure all text is externalized and easily translatable.

## 11. Publish and Maintain
- Merge the documentation into the main branch once approved.
- Update the project README or other central documentation files as needed.
- Regularly review and update the documentation to reflect changes in the project.

## 12. Security and Best Practices
- Avoid including sensitive information in the documentation.
- Store sensitive details (e.g., API keys) in environment variables and reference them appropriately.
